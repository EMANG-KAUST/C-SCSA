### Data generation
There are different types of signals you can generate, including:

|     Types     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **`Gaussian`**   | The Gaussian signal is recommended to be used in simulation, which [SCSA](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00498-012-0091-1.pdf) is good at characterizing. Signals such as [chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography) spectral peaks can be modeled by Gaussian peaks generation function. The users will be able to change the amplitude(hgt), position(pos) and width(wdt) of peak `[f, yf, yf0]=Gaussian_signal_generation(pos,hgt,wdt,0)` in favor of their options. Output of the function is yf0. To adjust output signal length, change `x = linspace(0,1,#{length});`in line 2 of Gaussian_signal_generation.m         |
|   `Regular`    | key='regular' or key='Piece-Regular'(options.alpha gives regularity). The users will be able to generate by `y = load_signal(key, signal_length, options)`.  |
|   `Bumps`    | key='Bumps'. The users will be able to generate by `y = load_signal(key, signal_length, options)`. |
|  `Sing`   | key='Sing'. The users will be able to generate by `y = load_signal(key, signal_length, options)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     `Noise(Gaussian)`     | Gaussian noise is statistical noise having a probability density function (PDF) equal to that of the normal distribution, which is also known as the Gaussian distribution. key='gaussiannoise' (options.sigma gives width of filtering in pixels). The users will be able to generate by `y = load_signal(key, signal_length, options)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   `Noise(Uniform)`   | Uniform noise refers to random noise generated in the interval (0,level), user can also specify the number of noise samples by `[n] = uniformNoise(length,level)`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If we want to create a piece-wise regular signal (around 500 samples) with uniform noise (distrubuted between (0,10), use the following command:

```matlab
y_clean = load_signal('Piece-Regular', 500);
n = uniformNoise(length(y_clean),10)';
y_noisy=y_clean+n;
```
More specifically, if we are generating gaussian signals with uniform noise (level%), use the following command:

```matlab
[f, yf, yf0]=Gaussian_signal_generation(pos,hgt,wdt,level);
```

For example, let's say we want to generate a 4-peak gaussian signal, with 50% of noise, we can simply type:

```matlab
pos=[2,3.6,7,9];
hgt= [2,4,4.5,7];
wdt=[2,3,3,4];
[f, yf, yf0]=Gaussian_signal_generation(pos,hgt,wdt,50);
plotGenFig(yf,yf0);
```

The generated 4-peak signal will look like below:

### Signal denoising with C-SCSA
To perform SCSA utilities, use the following function with the specifications:
|     Utilities    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **`C-SCSA`**   | Our main C-SCSA implementation. It is the entry point into the denoising algorithm, capable of taking any noisy signal as input (signals with 300-10000 samples are recommended for computing time perspectives). To peform denoising, simply use `[ yscsa,mse,snr ,psnr] = SCSAden( yf,yf0,v )` **function Input**: `v` is a smoothness parameter related to eq. (11) in our [paper](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1049/sil2.12023). `yf` is the noisy signal and `yf0` is the clean signal, with possible values between (-5,5). `v` varies with input signal types, signal length and sampling frequencies.  **function Output**: `yscsa` is the denoised signal. `snr` and `mse` is the SNR and mean squared error (MSE) of the denoised signal for evaluation purposes. |
|   `Fast`    | C-SCSA fast version. We are currenlty using _fminsearch_ to speed up the searching process in eq. (10) in our [paper](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1049/sil2.12023), which uses the simplex search method of [Lagarias et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216301003_Convergence_Properties_of_the_Nelder--Mead_Simplex_Method_in_Low_Dimensions). This version is currently in the research process and not available in the repository. |
|  `h_Select`   | Optimal `h` selection for denoising. This function is for testing purposes. Users will be able to extract the optimal `h` that bestly denoise a noisy signal `yf` by running:`[ de,h_optimal,snr ] = SCSA_H_Select( yf,yf0 )`. **function Input**:  `yf` is the noisy signal and `yf0` is the clean signal. **function Output**: `de` is the denoised signal. `h_optimal` is the `h` that provides the best denoising performance and `snr` is the highest SNR that SCSA method can achieve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  `Assembly`   | Denoise signal by separating whole signal into regions of interest and apply C-SCSA on each. This module is currently in its testing stages and is not available in the repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   `SCSA`    | SCSA reconstruction. Users can decompose the signal with a positive `h` value, by `[yscsa,Nh,EigV,EigF] = scsa_build(h,y)`. **function Input**: `h` is a positive value, also known as the [SCSA](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00498-012-0091-1.pdf) semi-classical constant. It can be selected by [Quantum-based interval selection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9287878). `y` is the input signal to be decomposed.  **function Output**: `yscsa` is the decomposed signal, `Nh` is the number of eigenfunctions. `EigV` is a matrix with eigenvalues on its diagonal (you can export the eigenvalues by `diag(EigV)`. `EigF` is the matrix of eigenfunctions. [UI interface](https://github.com/EMANG-KAUST/SCSA-reconstruction) of this tool is also available.  |


## Run a Demo (A quick start)
